# alfred-copyOpenSafariTabs
Alfred Workflow which copies all open safari tabs and pastes them as markdown references. It ignores pinned tabs.

The javascript to ignore pinned tabs was adapted from [Dan Thomas' Code in the keyboard maestro forum](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/macro-to-quickly-close-all-safari-tabs-except-pinned-and-current-one/4177/9)
